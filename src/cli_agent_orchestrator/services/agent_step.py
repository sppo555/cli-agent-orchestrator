"""Shared agent-step execution substrate (issue #312, unit N0).

``run_agent_step`` is the single canonical create -> input -> wait -> extract ->
teardown sequence for driving one agent through one step. It is the shared
substrate both step callers converge on, SERVER-SIDE:

- the run engine (N5, future) calls it directly IN-PROCESS;
- the handoff MCP client reaches it over the single combined HTTP endpoint
  ``POST /terminals/run-step`` (api/main.py), replacing its former six granular
  round-trips.

It depends ONLY on the terminal layer (``terminal_service`` + the provider
manager), so it is backend-agnostic (BR-10/RD-4): correctness holds on the tmux
backend alone, with no per-step tmux/herdr branching.

Failure contract (RD-2.1 / REL-3.3): ``run_agent_step`` returns an
``AgentStepResult`` ONLY on success (status COMPLETED). Every failure mode —
the readiness/completion wait timing out, the terminal reaching
``TerminalStatus.ERROR`` — RAISES a narrow exception. It NEVER returns a falsy
or ``None`` "success". The caller (engine) maps the raised exception to its 3x
retry policy (FR-5.3); the HTTP handler maps it to an ``HTTPException``.

    - ``COMPLETED`` — definitive done marker; returns immediately (unchanged).

    Sequence:
      1. Create a terminal (or reuse ``reuse_terminal_id``).
      2. Wait until it is ready to accept input (IDLE/COMPLETED).
      3. Send ``prompt`` (sync, bracketed-paste — the existing input path).
      4. Wait until COMPLETED (in-process status poll).
      5. Extract the last agent message (provider-specific extraction).
      6. Tear the terminal down unless ``teardown=False`` or it was reused.

    Args:
        provider: Provider type string (e.g. "kiro_cli", "claude_code").
        agent: Agent profile name.
        prompt: The message to send. Any caller-side prompt shaping (e.g. the
            codex handoff banner) is applied BEFORE calling this; the substrate
            sends ``prompt`` verbatim.
        session_name: Optional existing session to create the terminal in. When
            provided, the terminal is added as a window to that EXISTING session
            (``new_session=False``). When None, a brand-new tmux session is
            created for this step (``new_session=True``) — auto-naming the
            session inside ``create_terminal``. (Passing None with the implicit
            ``new_session=False`` would always fail: the auto-generated session
            does not yet exist.)
        reuse_terminal_id: Reuse an existing terminal instead of creating one.
            When set, the create + teardown steps are skipped (no pool; the
            caller owns the terminal's lifecycle).
        teardown: When True (default) and the terminal was created here, delete
            it after extraction. Ignored when ``reuse_terminal_id`` is set.
        timeout: Max seconds to wait for the step to reach COMPLETED.
        ready_timeout: Max seconds to wait for a freshly created terminal to be
            ready to accept input.
        working_directory: Optional working directory for a freshly created
            terminal (ignored when reusing a terminal). When None and
            ``caller_id`` is set, the worker inherits the caller's pane CWD
            via ``get_working_directory()`` (best-effort; falls back to the
            server default on failure).
        caller_id: Terminal ID of the supervisor creating this terminal, recorded
            so ``send_message`` can route callbacks structurally (issue #284).
            Also used to inherit the working directory when
            ``working_directory`` is None (best-effort). None for
            operator-launched / engine steps with no supervisor.
        allowed_tools: Resolved allowed-tools list for the freshly created
            terminal (handoff inheritance). None lets ``create_terminal`` derive
            them from the agent profile.
        registry: Plugin registry forwarded to ``delete_terminal`` on teardown so
            ``post_kill_terminal`` plugin hooks fire (parity with the DELETE
            endpoint). None (the in-process engine path today) means no hooks
            dispatch — behavior unchanged.
        env_vars: Optional per-step environment variables to inject into a freshly
            created terminal (ignored when reusing a terminal). The run engine (N5)
            uses this to set ``CAO_WORKFLOW_RUN_ID`` / ``CAO_WORKFLOW_STEP_ID`` so
            the worker's ``workflow_return`` tool routes its structured output to
            the correct ``(run_id, step_id)`` store key. With ``session_name=None``
            the substrate creates a fresh session per step, so the per-step env is
            injected cleanly (no stale step_id from a shared session). Default None
            = behavior unchanged (the handoff caller passes nothing).
        on_terminal_created: Optional callback invoked with the ``terminal_id``
            IMMEDIATELY after a freshly created terminal exists (before the
            readiness wait / input). U4's script-tier orphan sweep (BR-31) uses
            this to record the live terminal into the shared ``ScriptRunRecord``
            ``step_states`` map AT terminal-creation time — so a subprocess that
            crashes/times out while a run-step call is mid-flight still leaves the
            in-flight terminal visible to ``_reconcile_orphans``. Not called for a
            reused terminal (the caller already owns it). A callback exception is
            logged and swallowed — recording a terminal for the sweep must never
            fail the step. Default None = behavior unchanged.
        cancel_event: Optional ``asyncio.Event`` the engine sets to interrupt an
            in-flight completion wait (issue #409b). When set mid-wait, the step
            wait is abandoned promptly (not at the next natural boundary) and a
            ``StepCancelledError`` is raised — after tearing down a terminal this
            call created. This is what makes a hung run cancellable: the run whose
            provider never emits a completion signal is exactly the run that could
            not otherwise be killed. Default None = no cancellation seam (the
            handoff caller passes nothing) — behavior unchanged.

    Returns:
        ``AgentStepResult`` with status COMPLETED — ONLY on success.

    Raises:
        StepExecutionError: readiness/completion wait timed out (``kind="timeout"``)
            or the terminal reached ``TerminalStatus.ERROR`` (``kind="error"``).
            ``terminal_id`` carries the live terminal so the caller can clean up.
        StepCancelledError: ``cancel_event`` fired during the completion wait
            (issue #409b) — a cancellation, NOT a run-failure (do not retry).
        ValueError / TimeoutError: propagated from ``terminal_service`` (e.g.
            terminal-create failure, unknown terminal) — surfaced, never swallowed.
